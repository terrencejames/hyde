  <p>What’s up friends,</p>

<p>The site should finally now be live! A little bit of info about how the site is run:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, s/o to their free hosting and repository integration</li>
  <li>The domain name is hosted from <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. Also s/o to them for my free domain name for one year (you can probably notice a pattern going on here).</li>
  <li>The site and its pages are generated using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which (surprise surprise) is also free. It was the first time I had to set up a Ruby environment, and I got to say everything’s pretty slick. Definitely will need to add more exploration onto my to-do list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although everything was relatively easy to set up, I also ran into a lot of troubles, particularly pertaining to that snazzy “/s/” in my URL name (because terrenceja.me would pretty much be lame and make no sense):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding and installing a theme outside of the GitHub Pages supported ones was difficult; a lot of compatibility issues definitely needed to be resolved especially since some of these themes are built using Jekyll 2.0 instead of Jekyll 3.0.</li>
  <li>I probably spent a couple days trying to make that “/s” redirect correctly, playing with everything from the config.yml file to the directory locations of my files. A common issue would be that the CSS wouldn’t be referenced correctly, and I ended up making a really hacky but terrible practice solution by hardcoding “/s” onto the HTML file references. This was before I realized/forgot I could check the Chrome Developer Console to check the error messages (oops). I definitely was way too excited to get this junk live so I settled for the fix, but I probably should fix it properly in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my extraordinarly basic site. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions or concerns!</p>
